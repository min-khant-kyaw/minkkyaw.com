# Previoulsy,
During [Part 1](http://localhost:3000/blog/image-regonition-model-p1) of building our Image Recognition model, we finished labelling the pictures that we will be using to train the model. For this guide, I've only labelled 100 images and will be proceeding to generate Traning data needed to train the TensorFlow model.

<br />

### To do list

5. Generating Training Data
6. Creating Label Map and Configuring Training
7. Training The Model

## 5. Generating Training Data
After done labelling, it is now time to generate data to train the TensorFlow model. We will be generating TFRecords that will serve as training to the TensorFlow training model. We will be using xml_to_cs.py and generate_tfrecord.py scripts from [Dat Tranâ€™s Raccoon Detector dataset](http://github.com/datitran/raccoon_dataset) while making slight modifications to our scripts to work with our directory structure.
