# The morning

**Driiiiin.. It's 6:35 AM.** I reach my hands under the pillow and start searching for my phone. Found it. Great. I press the sleep button.

**Driiiiin.. It's 6:45 AM.**

**Driiiiin.. It's 6:55 AM.** I launch myself up and started preparing for my day. It's my first day of the job after all. An important day that will turn me from a teenager to an adult. I quickly get ready and head to the nearest MRT to take the transit to my workplace.

> 8:20 AM
> I reach the office. The company is quite small so there isn't a lot of people there. I take a seat and waited for the HR department to take me around the office and introduce me to my colleagues.x
