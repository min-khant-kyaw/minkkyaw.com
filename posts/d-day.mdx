# The morning

**Driiiiin.. It's 6:45 AM.** I reached my hands under the pillow and started searching for my phone. Found it. Great. I pressed the sleep button.

**Driiiiin.. It's 6:55 AM.**

**Driiiiin.. It's 7:25 AM.** I launched myself up and started preparing for my day. It was my first day of the job after all. An important day that will turn me to an adult. I quickly got ready and headed to the nearest MRT to take the transit to my workplace.

<br />

**8:45 AM**

I reached the office. The company wass quite small so there was not a lot of people there. I took a seat and waited for the HR department to take me around the office and introduce me to my colleagues. I was handed a contract of employment to read, verify and sign. By signing the document, I will be officially employed and be on a 3 month probation period to monitor my performance. Upon reading the contract, I realised that I will be working 5.5 days, Mon-Fri 9am-6pm and Sat 9am-1pm.
<Serious>Please ask for the work timings during the interview and not automatically assume that all jobs are 9-5 from Monday to Friday.</Serious>
Being unaware of this, I informed the HR department that the documents they provided before my acceptance did not state that I will be working 5.5 days. After a short talk, we came to an agreement and I've officially become a full-time software developer at Arrowcrest Technologies.

# The noon

**1:05 pm**

Lunch was provided as it is the first day of returning to work from the 1 month circuit breaker period due to the high rise of COVID-19 cases in Singapore. After lunch, I had a discussion with the software team on the ongoing projects and projects that needed to be maintained. Since this is my first job, I hoped to be tasked to provide maintainence to the existing software while also helping the team in projects.

I was given a laptop to work on with the needed IDEs and programs installed. They also helped set up a local development environment of their Customer Relationship Mnagement(CRM) System for me to play around with the features and understand the software life cycle. I was told that I will mainly be tasked to maintaining the CRM website while also working on new features for the CRM, working under another software developer. 

# The evening

**4:17 pm**

After given the necessary set up for me to start my work, I was released early to review and understand the code they used to develop the CRM. I took note of some of the most important features and started reviewing what each function does. It was my first time seeing a CRM system, so I went to research on what features a CRM should have. I was able to recognise some of the features that the current CRM system was lacking and starting noting then down.
