sweated profusely before clicking on it, and finally decided to click on the attached pdf file. <span style={{color: 'red'}}>I GOT OFFERED</span> I was ecstatic!! On one hand, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to handle the stress of having a full-time job and Computer Science classes at night. On the other hand, I was excited about my next chapter and possibly be on the way to become a software engineer. 

# School Fees

Before accepting the admission, Reality hits... The school prices are increased in the midst of COVID-19, prices for international students increased from $50,000 to a whopping $80,000 for the duration of study. It was a <span style={{color: 'red'}}>50% INCREASE</span>.

I grabbed the nearlest calculator, which was opening up the calcualtor app, and started recalculating my savings, salary and have to restructure my financial plans. Will I be able to make it past 4 years with this much money?? Hmm, there are other factors to consider too.

# Accepting the offer

I would be able to make it if I reduced my spendings on urges to buy things I found interesting. I checked my list of spending and boy was I not surprised to find out that I was spending half of it on unneccesary urges. I also discussed these matters with my family, asking them whether they'd be able to help me if I needed some financial assistance. After much consideration, I accepted the offer and was ready to begin the new journey.

# Follow the adventure

Well, it is not going to be easy, but it sure is going to be interesting. Will I pass this ultimate test or will I break down and fail this? Follow my adventure and find out!!
