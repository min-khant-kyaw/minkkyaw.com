# It actually happened

Just a normal start of the week.. Feeling grumpy, Getting Monday Blues and Doing my normal morning routine.

I check my phone and chat groups are blowing up. **100 messages.. 200 messages..** Something is not right. I scrolled throught the conversations they are having, one after another news articles were linked. 

One of our favorite rappers probably passed on.. I thought as I put on my spectacles. Boy, was I wrong, apparently a coup d'etat just happened in my country. Democratically elected leaders are detained and military troops are patrolling the streets.

# Unpleasant Memories

**8888 uprisng... 2008 Saffron protests...**

Unpleasant stories that my parents told me about military dictatorship came back to me as I remembered how life was during military rule. The contrast between the country when I left at 2014 and when I visited at 2019 was like Yin and Yang. The people were happy, lots and lots of investments are coming to the country and the GDP seems to be growing steadily.
