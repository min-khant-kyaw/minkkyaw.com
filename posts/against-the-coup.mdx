# It actually happened

Just a normal start of the week.. Feeling grumpy, Getting Monday Blues and Doing my normal morning routine.
<br />

I check my phone and chat groups are blowing up. **100 messages.. 200 messages..** Something is not right. I scroll through the conversations they are having, one after another news articles are being linked. 
<br />

One of our favorite rappers probably passed on.. I thought as I put on my spectacles. Boy, was I wrong, apparently a coup d'etat just happened in my country. Democratically elected leaders are detained and military troops are patrolling the streets.

# Unpleasant Memories

Unpleasant stories that my parents told me about military dictatorship came back to me as I remembered how life was during military rule. The contrast between the country when I left at 2013 and when I visited at 2019 was like **Yin and Yang**. The people were happy, lots and lots of **investments are coming** to the country and the GDP seems to be growing steadily. 
<br />

I still think about the times where **telecommunications** were a luxury. SIM cards' cost would range from hundreds to thousands of dollars. I remember losing a mobile phone carelessly and my mother yelling me as she will now have to go through the trouble of cancelling and activating a new SIM card. That SIM card cost her **thousands of dollars** to purchase and she was not losing it. The focus wasn't even on the mobile phone, it was on the tiny **SIM card**.
<br />

Internet was also a luxury. The internet speed is slowly improving however, during those times, the internet speeds were atrocious. We are paying $40 a month to get **500kb/s DOWNLOAD speed**. This means **144p for YouTube** and slow loading speeds for Social Media. Social Media was so rarely used that **Facebook** was unheard of in the country.
<br />

Electricity was also another luxury. I remember having blackouts at **scheduled timings daily**. Electricity would come and go on a **8-hour interval**. I still remember the times when my family would call the Electric Power Corporation (EPC) and complain about electricity **not coming back on on time**. They would sometimes take away 30 minutes to an hour of the precious electricity time and could hear the whole neighbourhood cursing at the power plant as they miss their favorite K-drama. But when it's time for a blackout, electricity would always get **cut off right on time**, like students leaving as soon as the bell rings. It wasn't until 2009 when I travelled to another country that I realised that **Electricity wasn't a luxury, it was a necessity**.

# Lost friendships

<BlockQuote>Someone on here recently tweeted something about "I haven't lost friends over politics, I've lost friends over morals" and I can't stop thinking about it. People think "politics" is this separate, supra-human thing, but it's your morals in action. <br />- Emily L. Hauser</BlockQuote>

I **lost some friends** during this time of the coup, while I **gained some** as well. Losing friends is hard as I truly value the people that I have in my circle. I usually only keep a handful of friends as I like to keep my circle close and tight. I also stopped talking to those who still struggle or refuse to choose a side during this time when the **unjustified actions** are clear and obvious.
<br />

Never once have I thought that I will be losing friends **over politics**. I am usually uninterested and ignorant in political issues, but this coup has made me realise that I actually care about my country's **future**. The government plays a huge role and impacts evrey aspect of our lives.

# Conclusion

As a citizen of Myanmar residing in a foreign country, there is not much we can do to help other than to raise awareness about the coup and request for international support on social media platforms. Moreover, My friends and I have teamed up together to create a website, targeted towards both the local and international community to help raise awareness on my country's current affairs while also helping the local community with peacuful protesting guidelines. The website can be found at [https://savemyanmar2021.com](https://savemyanmar2021.com).
