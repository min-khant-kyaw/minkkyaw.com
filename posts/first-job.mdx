# My first job offer

I've just accepted a job offer to be a software developer for a newly found software team. It was my first job offer and I'm scared that I might have made a rash decision on accepting the offer. I was so nervous that I accepted the offer without even thinking much about it. On my way back from the interview, I remember a quote from someone close to me

> Your first job will not matter that much in the long run. Make your first job as data reference for your future endeavours. If you are unhappy with the first job, make sure that you recognise your likes and dislikes and use them as a reference to seek for another job.

> At work, there are different types of people. There are also different ways people measure success. For some, having a job is considered a success, whereas for others, being able to win a project is considered a success. The success ruler is different for everyone and make sure you don't measure their success with your ruler. Doing this will create problems and cause an unhappy environment to work at.

# Things I've learnt

Just after the acceptance, I got a phone call update from two more interviewers stating that I passed the interview and would like to know more about me. I immediately apologised and told them that I will not be able to come for it as I have already accepted an offer. **Don't do this! You can still accept other offers and access which company better suits your needs. Keep the doors open as much as possible. You might prefer the company culture and the environment of another company more than the company you accepted the offer.** 

# Conslusion

However, I am still grateful that I am able to secure the job so early in my career. The job offer came even before I graduate. I am excited to be entering the workforce and maybe making a slight impact in the industy as well.
